Overview
========

Icons
-----

The only icons in hicolor here are pattern-* for yast-packager. Other icons are
shipped with the module that uses them.

Oxygen and Crystal themes are still shipped, but pretty much deprecated due to
lack of maintenance.

Wizard
------

This is the fancy YaST theme used in the Qt installation workflow.

The `openSUSE/wizard` counterpart to `SLE/wizard` lives
in the `yast` directory of the [openSUSE branding repository][branding].
